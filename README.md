# Vault

Vault is a basic command line file backup tool. It's supplied with an input config file that specifies the folders to be copied, where they will be copied to, what folders/files to ignore, and if files with the same name should be overwritten (if they already exist in the output folder).

## Compatibility

Vault currently only works on Windows, it assumes paths are in the Windows format.
